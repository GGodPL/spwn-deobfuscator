## spwn-deobfuscator
 Deobfuscates [itsmebombie/spwn-obfuscator](https://github.com/itsmebombie/spwn-obfuscator).
 It might be buggy and I don't recommend using it.

# Arguments
 `deobfuscate(input: @string, change_variable_names: @bool = true, remove_comments: @bool = true)`
 
 `input` is code generated by obfuscator

 `change_variable_names` changes all of the randomized names to \_\_var\_(index number). For example the first variable in the file will be \_\_var\_0.

 `remove_comments` removes all of the /* \*/ comments in the file.
